# 100 Days of Python Learning Plan with Mini Projects

## Phase 1: Python Basics (Days 1-20)

1. Variables, data types, and basic operations - Mini Project: Simple Calculator

This project will help you practice using variables, different data types, and basic operations in Python.

## Variables:

We use variables like choice, num1, and num2 to store user input and intermediate results.

## Data Types:

- Strings: For user input and messages (e.g., choice, "Welcome to the Simple Calculator!")
- Floats: For numerical inputs and calculations (num1, num2)
- Booleans: Implicitly used in conditional statements

## Basic Operations:

- Arithmetic: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)
- Comparison: Equality (==), membership (in)
- Functions: We define functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
- Conditional Statements: We use if, elif, and else to handle different user choices and error cases.
- Loops: A while loop is used to keep the calculator running until the user chooses to quit.
- User Input: We use the input() function to get user input.
- Type Conversion: We convert the user's numerical inputs to floats using float().

## To run this project:

- Copy the code into a new Python file (e.g., calculator.py).
- Run the file using Python (e.g., python calculator.py in the command line).
- Follow the prompts to perform calculations.
