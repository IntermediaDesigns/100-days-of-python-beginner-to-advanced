# Text-based Adventure Game

Let's create a Text-based Adventure Game that combines multiple Python concepts we've learned, including classes, inheritance, file handling, error handling, and more. This will be a fun way to put together everything we've learned so far.


This project combines multiple Python concepts we've learned:

### Classes and Objects:
- Multiple classes (Item, Character, Enemy, Room, Game)
- Inheritance (Enemy inherits from Character)
- Class methods and properties

### File I/O:
- Save/Load game functionality using JSON
- Error handling for file operations

### Type Hints:
- Using type annotations for better code readability
- Lists and Dictionaries with specific types

### Error Handling:
- Try/except blocks for input validation
- File operation error handling

### Data Structures:
- Lists for inventory and rooms
- Dictionaries for room connections

### String Formatting:
- F-strings for output
- Multi-line strings for descriptions

### Control Flow:
- While loops for game loop
- If/elif/else for decision making

### Input/Output:
- User input handling
- Formatted text output

### Time and Random:
- Random numbers for combat
- Timestamps for save files

## To run this project:
1. Copy the code into a new Python file (e.g., `adventure_game.py`).
2. Run the file using Python (e.g., `python adventure_game.py` in the command line).
3. Follow the prompts to play the game.
