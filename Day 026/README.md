# Day 26 Map, filter, and reduce functions - Mini Project: Data Transformation Pipeline

![Data Transformation](/Day%20026/pipeline.py)


A functional programming approach to efficiently process and analyze data through chainable operations.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build data transformation pipelines using functional programming concepts like map, filter, and reduce. It provides a flexible framework for processing data through sequential transformations while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Map Function
```python
map_transform = lambda data: list(map(transform, data))
```
- Transforms each element in a sequence
- Returns a new sequence of transformed elements

### 2. Filter Function
```python
filter_by_condition = lambda data: list(filter(condition, data))
```
- Filters elements based on a condition
- Returns elements that meet the condition

### 3. Reduce Function
```python
reduce_aggregate = lambda data: reduce(operation, data)
```
- Aggregates elements into a single value
- Applies operation cumulatively

### 4. Pipeline Creation
```python
def create_pipeline(*functions): 
    return reduce(lambda x, f: f(x), functions, data)
```
- Combines multiple functions into a pipeline
- Processes data through sequential transformations
